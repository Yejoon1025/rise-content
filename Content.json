{
  "Home1": "The current production of chemicals is heavily dependent on fossil fuels and accounts for 5~6% of global greenhouse emissions",
  "Home2": "The U.S. produces over 700 bn cubic feet of biogas (a mix of CH4 and CO2) a year from landfills, farms, and wastewater treatment plants",
  "Home3": "But a large part of that biogas is not properly utilized - around 60% is either wasted or converted into low-margin products like electricity",
  "Home4Title": "RISE REFORMING",
  "Home4": "repurposes biogas into dimethyl ether (DME), an in-demand and versatile chemical",
  "Home5": "DME’s global market size is almost $10 bn and is expected to double over the next decade",
  "Home6Title": "BIOGAS PRODUCERS:",
  "Home6": "Selling us your biogas instead of flaring it or generating grid electricity can double your margins",
  "Home7Title": "SUPERIOR PROPELLANT:",
  "Home7": "Aerosol companies call DME the \"Rolls Royce of propellants,\" perfect for products like air fresheners, hairspray, and more",
  "Home8Title": "ALTERNATIVE FUEL:",
  "Home8": "Similar to ethanol and gasoline, DME can be blended with propane to create a low-carbon and more efficient fuel",
  "Home9": "Every kg of Rise's DME avoids nearly 3 kg CO2eq",
  "Home10": "That's almost 5 miles in a Ford F-150 avoided per kg of Rise's DME",
  "Tech1Title": "CLEAN",
  "Tech1": "the biogas from contaminants",
  "Tech2Title": "REFORM",
  "Tech2": "the biogas into syngas",
  "Tech3": "Syngas is the building block for many other chemicals such as methanol, gasoline, diesel, SAF, and formaldehyde",
  "Tech4": "CLEAN and UPGRADE are fully commercialized processes. Our REFORMing step links these two, enabling the competitive production of low-carbon chemicals",
  "Tech5Title": "UPGRADE",
  "Tech5": "the syngas into DME",
  "Tech6Title": "MODULAR",
  "Tech6": "Allows for rapid and in-situ deployment, greater reach, lower CAPEX, quicker payback, and easy scalability",
  "Tech7Title": "CLIMATE POSITIVE",
  "Tech7": "Rise's DME is produced without the extraction, processing, and transportation of fossil fuels as raw materials",
  "Tech8Title": "PRICE COMPETITIVE",
  "Tech8": "Rise's DME competes pricewise with traditional fossil-fuel derived DME"
